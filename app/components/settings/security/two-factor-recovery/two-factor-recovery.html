<h3>Two-factor recovery codes</h3>

<p class="error">{{error}}</p>

<p>Recovery codes can be used to access your account in the event you lose
    access to your device and cannot receive two-factor authentication codes.
</p>

<p>
    Treat your recovery codes with the same level of care as you would your password!
    We recommend saving them with a password manager such as Lastpass, 1Password, or Keeper.
</p>

<p class="warning">
    <strong>Put these in a safe spot.</strong>
    If you lose your device and don't have the recovery codes you will lose access to your account.
</p>

<ul>
    <li *ngFor="let code of backupCodes">{{code}}</li>
</ul>

<p>When you generate new recovery codes, you must download or print the new codes. Your old codes won't work anymore.</p>
