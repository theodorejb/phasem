<h3>Two-factor recovery codes</h3>

<p class="error">{{error}}</p>

<p>Recovery codes are necessary to access your account in the event you
    cannot receive two-factor authentication codes (e.g. when you get a new phone).
</p>

<p>
    Treat your recovery codes with the same level of care as you would your password!
    We recommend saving them with a password manager such as Lastpass, 1Password, or Keeper.
</p>

<p *ngIf="backupCodes.length === 0; else notAllUsed" class="warning">
    <strong>All codes have been used.</strong>
    Generate a new set to avoid losing access to your account.
</p>

<ng-template #notAllUsed>
    <p class="warning">
        <strong>Put these in a safe spot.</strong>
        If you lose your device and don't have the recovery codes you will lose access to your account.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li *ngFor="let code of backupCodes">{{code}}</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        When you generate new recovery codes, you must download or print the new codes.
        Your old codes won't work anymore.
