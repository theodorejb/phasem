<p class="warning">Recovery codes are necessary to access your account in the event
    you cannot receive two-factor authentication codes (e.g. when you get a new phone).</p>
<p>Save or print these recovery codes before continuing two-factor authentication setup.</p>

        <strong>Treat your recovery codes with the same level of care as you would your password!</strong>
        We recommend saving them with a password manager such as Lastpass, 1Password, or Keeper.
